This project intends to succesfully read a Google Sheets file.

You have to add a file with spreadsheets id to be able to use it properly. More on google sheets API documentation.

Command "npm run dev" starts the server on port 3000.

Next step is going to make it possible to read the file inside (rows and cells). Right now it is only possible to read the meta data of the file.
